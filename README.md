# Instacart Customer Orders Analysis
Instacart
I discovered this Instacart customer orders data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data), and was curious to find out the following about 3.2M grocery orders placed by over 200,000 Instacart customers:
* What products are most commonly purchased?
* What shopping patterns are exhibited by these customers?
** Do they have a preferred shopping day and time of day?
** How often do customers shop? Weekly? Bi-weekly?

I cleaned, prepared and analyzed the avaialble data sets using Python. The Python codes I used are stored in this repository.

# Findings
Here are the insights I uncovered from analyzing these data sets:
* 29.2% of all purchased products were from the Produce department.
** 8.9% of all purchased produce were bananas.
* 34.7% of all orders were placed on Sundays and Mondays.
* 64.9% of orders were recorded between 9am and 4pm daily, with peak order volume (8.4% of total orders) recorded at 10am.
* Largest customer re-orders in descending order are experienced on a 30-day, 7-day and 6-day cycle.

A visual representation of my findings are also published in this [Instacart Customer Order Analysis Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/IntacartOrderAnalysis/InstacartCustomerOrderAnalysis?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
