# Instacart Customer Orders Analysis
I discovered these Instacart customer orders data sets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data), and was curious to find out the following about **3.2M** grocery orders placed by over **200,000** Instacart customers:
* What products are most commonly purchased?
* What shopping patterns are exhibited by customers?
  * Do they have preferred shopping days/times?
  * How often do customers shop? Weekly? Bi-weekly?

I cleaned, prepared and analyzed the avaialble data sets using Python. The Python codes I used are stored in this repository.

# Findings
Here are the insights I uncovered from analyzing these data sets:
* **29.2%** of all purchased products were from the Produce department.
  * **8.9%** of all purchased produce were bananas.
* **34.7%** of all orders were placed on Saturdays and Sundays.
* **64.9%** of orders were recorded between **9am and 4pm** daily.
* Minimum order volumes (**0.15%** of all orders) were recorded between **3am and 4am** daily.
* Largest customer re-orders in descending order are experienced on a **30-day**, **7-day** and **6-day** cycle.

A visual representation of my findings are also published in this [Instacart Customer Order Analysis Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/IntacartOrderAnalysis/InstacartCustomerOrderAnalysis?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
